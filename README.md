## 📌 Features  
✅ AI-powered disease detection (e.g., Pneumonia, Alzheimer’s)  
✅ Secure and user-friendly Flutter-based mobile app  
✅ Medical chatbot for instant health-related assistance  
✅ Rapid diagnosis through deep learning models  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **AI/ML Models:** TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Deep Learning  
- **Models Used:**  
  - BioGPT (Medical chatbot)  
  - Vision Transformer (MRI scans analysis)  
  - CheXNet (Chest X-ray classification)  

## 📷 Project Workflow  
1. **Upload** an X-ray or MRI image in the mobile app  
2. **Flask backend** processes the image using AI models  
3. **AI Prediction** is generated and displayed in the app
